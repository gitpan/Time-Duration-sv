NAME
    Time::Duration::sv - rounded or exact Swedish expression of durations

SYNOPSIS
    Example use in a program that ends by noting its runtime:

      my $start_time = time();
      use Time::Duration::sv;
  
      # then things that take all that time, and then ends:
      print "Runtime ", duration(time() - $start_time), ".\n";

    Example use in a program that reports age of a file:

      use Time::Duration::sv;
      my $file = 'that_file';
      my $age = $^T - (stat($file))[9];  # 9 = modtime
      print "$file was modified ", ago($age);
